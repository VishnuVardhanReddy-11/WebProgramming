</font><p align="justify"><font color="#99ccff" size="5">Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. It is a gaseous
cyan-coloured ice giant. Most of the planet is made of water, ammonia, and methane in a supercritical phase of matter,
which astronomy calls "ice" or volatiles. The planet's atmosphere has a complex layered cloud structure and has the lowest
minimum temperature (49 K (−224 °C; −371 °F)) of all the Solar System's planets. It has
a marked axial tilt of 82.23° with a
retrograde rotation period of 17 hours and 14 minutes. This means that in an 84-Earth- year orbital period around the Sun, its
poles get around 42 years of continuous sunlight, followed by 42 years of continuous darkness.
</p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#99ccff" size="5">Uranus has the third-largest diameter and fourth-largest mass among the
Solar System's planets. Based on current models, inside its volatile mantle layer is a rocky core, and surrounding it is a
thick hydrogen and helium atmosphere. Trace amounts of hydrocarbons (thought to be produced via hydrolysis) and carbon monoxide
along with carbon dioxide (thought to have been originated from comets) have been detected in the upper atmosphere. There are
many unexplained climate phenomena in Uranus's atmosphere, such as its peak wind speed of 900 km/h (560 mph),
variations in its polar cap, and its erratic cloud formation. The planet also has very low internal heat compared to other
giant planets, the cause of which remains unclear.
</p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#99ccff" size="5">Like the other giant planets, Uranus has a ring system, a magnetosphere,
 
and many natural satellites. The extremely dark ring system reflects only about 2% of the incoming light. Uranus's 28 natural
satellites include 18 known regular moons, of which 13 are small inner moons. Further out are the larger five major moons of
the planet: Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, and Oberon. Orbiting at a much greater distance from Uranus are the ten known
irregular moons. The planet's magnetosphere is highly asymmetric and has many charged particles, which may be the cause of the
darkening of its rings and moons.
</p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#99ccff" size="5">Like the classical planets, Uranus is visible to the naked eye,
but it was never recognised as a planet by ancient observers because of its dimness and slow orbit.
William Herschel first observed Uranus on 13 March 1781, leading to its discovery as a planet, expanding
the known boundaries of the Solar System for the first time in history and making Uranus the first planet
classified as such with the aid of a telescope. The discovery of Uranus also effectively doubled the size of the
known Solar System because Uranus is around twice the distance from the Sun as the planet Saturn.
