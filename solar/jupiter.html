<p align="justify"><font color="#99ccff" size="5">Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest
in the Solar System. It is a gas giant with a mass more than 2.5 times that of all the other planets in the
Solar System combined and slightly less than one-thousandth the mass of the Sun. Its diameter is eleven
times that of Earth, and a tenth that of the Sun. Jupiter orbits the Sun at a distance of 5.20 AU (778.5
Gm), with an orbital period of 11.86 years. It is the third-brightest natural object in the Earth's night sky,
after the Moon and Venus, and has been observed since prehistoric times. Its name derives from that of
Jupiter, the chief deity of ancient Roman religion.
</p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#99ccff" size="5">Jupiter was the first of the Sun's planets to form, and
 
its inward migration during the primordial phase of the Solar System affected much of the formation
history of the other planets. Jupiter's atmosphere consists of 76% hydrogen and 24% helium by mass,
with a denser interior. It contains trace elements and compounds like carbon, oxygen, sulfur, neon,
ammonia, water vapour, phosphine, hydrogen sulfide, and hydrocarbons. Jupiter's helium abundance is
80% of the Sun's, similar to Saturn's composition.
</p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#99ccff" size="5">The ongoing contraction of Jupiter's interior generates
more heat than the planet receives from the Sun. Its internal structure is believed to consist of an outer
mantle of fluid metallic hydrogen and a diffuse inner core of denser material. Because of its rapid rate of
rotation, one turn in ten hours, Jupiter is an oblate spheroid; it has a slight but noticeable bulge around
the equator. The outer atmosphere is divided into a series of latitudinal bands, with turbulence and
storms along their interacting boundaries; the most obvious result of this is the Great Red Spot, a giant
storm that has been recorded since 1831.
</p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#99ccff" size="5">Jupiter's magnetic field is the strongest and secondlargest contiguous structure in the Solar System, generated by eddy currents within the fluid, metallic
hydrogen core. The solar wind interacts with the magnetosphere, extending it outward and affecting
 
Jupiter's orbit. Jupiter is surrounded by a faint system of planetary rings that were discovered in 1979 by
Voyager 1 and further investigated by the Galileo orbiter in the 1990s.
</p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#99ccff" size="5">At least 95 moons orbit the planet; the four largest
moons—Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto—orbit within the magnetosphere, and were discovered by
Galileo Galilei in 1610. Ganymede, the largest of the four, is larger than the planet Mercury. Since 1973,
Jupiter has been visited by nine robotic probes: seven flybys and two dedicated orbiters, with two more
en route.
