It is the fourth-largest planet in the Solar System by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet.
It is 17 times the mass of Earth. Compared to its fellow ice giant Uranus, Neptune is slightly more massive, but denser and
smaller. Being composed primarily of gases and liquids,it has no well-defined solid surface, and orbits the Sun once
every 164.8 years at an orbital distance of 30.1 astronomical units (4.5 billion kilometres; 2.8 billion miles). It is named
after the Roman god of the sea and has the astronomical symbol â™†, representing Neptune's trident.
</p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#99ccff" size="5">Neptune is not visible to the unaided eye and is the only planet
in the Solar System that was found from mathematical predictions derived from indirect observations rather than being
initially observed by direct empirical observation, when unexpected changes in the orbit of Uranus led Alexis Bouvard to
hypothesise that its orbit was subject to gravitational perturbation by an unknown planet.
After Bouvard's death, the p
osition of Neptune was predicted from his observations, independently, by John Couch Adams and Urbain Le Verrier. Neptune
was subsequently directly observed with a telescope on 23 September 1846 by Johann Gottfried Galle within a degree of the
position predicted by Le Verrier. Its largest moon, Triton, was discovered shortly thereafter, though none of the planet's
remaining moons were located telescopically until the 20th century.
</p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#99ccff" size="5">The planet's distance from Earth gives it a small apparent size, and its di
 
stance from the Sun renders it very dim, making it challenging to study with Earth-based telescopes. Only the advent of the H
ubble Space Telescope and of large ground-based telescopes with adaptive optics allowed for detailed observations. Neptune
was visited by Voyager 2, which flew by the planet on 25 August 1989; Voyager 2 remains the only spacecraft to have visited it.
</p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#99ccff" size="5">n contrast to the strongly seasonal atmosphere of Uranus, which can be featur
eless for long periods of time, Neptune's atmosphere has active and consistently visible weather patterns. At the time of the
Voyager 2 flyby in 1989, the planet's southern hemisphere had a Great Dark Spot comparable to the Great Red Spot on Jupiter.
In 2018, a newer main dark spot and smaller dark spot were identified and studied.
