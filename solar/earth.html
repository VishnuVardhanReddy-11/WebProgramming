<p align="justify"><font color="#99ccff" size="5">Earth is the third planet from tṇhe Sun and the only
astronomical object known to harbor life. This is enabled by Earth being an ocean world, the only one in
the Solar System sustaining liquid surface water. Almost all of Earth's water is contained in its global
ocean, covering 70.8% of Earth's crust. The remaining 29.2% of Earth's crust is land, most of which is
located in the form of continental landmasses within Earth's land hemisphere. Most of Earth's land is at
least somewhat humid and covered by vegetation, while large sheets of ice at Earth's polar deserts
retain more water than Earth's groundwater, lakes, rivers and atmospheric water combined. Earth's
crust consists of slowly moving tectonic plates, which interact to produce mountain ranges, volcanoes,
and earthquakes. Earth has a liquid outer core that generates a magnetosphere capable of deflecting
most of the destructive solar winds and cosmic radiation.
</p><p align="justify"><font color="#99ccff" size="5">Earth has a dynamic atmosphere, which sustains
Earth's surface conditions and protects it from most meteoroids and UV-light at entry. It has a
composition of primarily nitrogen and oxygen. Water vapor is widely present in the atmosphere,
forming clouds that cover most of the planet. The water vapor acts as a greenhouse gas and, together
 
with other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2), creates the
conditions for both liquid surface water and water vapor to persist via the capturing of energy from the
Sun's light. </p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#99ccff" size="5">This process maintains the current average surface
temperature of 14.76 °C (58.57 °F), at which water is liquid under normal atmospheric pressure.
Differences in the amount of captured energy between geographic regions (as with the equatorial
region receiving more sunlight than the polar regions) drive atmospheric and ocean currents, producing
a global climate system with different climate regions, and a range of weather phenomena such as
precipitation, allowing components such as nitrogen to cycle. </p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#99ccff" size="5">Earth is rounded into an ellipsoid with a circumference
of about 40,000 km. It is the densest planet in the Solar System. Of the four rocky planets, it is the
largest and most massive. Earth is about eight light-minutes away from the Sun and orbits it, taking a
year (about 365.25 days) to complete one revolution. Earth rotates around its own axis in slightly less
than a day (in about 23 hours and 56 minutes). Earth's axis of rotation is tilted with respect to the
perpendicular to its orbital plane around the Sun, producing seasons.</p>
