bodies beyond the orbit of Neptune. It is the ninth-largest and tenth-most-massive known object to directly orbit the Sun.
It is the largest known trans-Neptunian object by volume, by a small margin, but is less massive than Eris. Like other Kuiper
belt objects, Pluto is made primarily of ice and rock and is much smaller than the inner planets. Pluto has roughly one-sixth
the mass of the Moon, and one-third its volume.
</p>
 
<p align="justify"><font color="#99ccff" size="5">Pluto has a moderately eccentric and inclined orbit, ranging from 30 to 49
astronomical units (4.5 to 7.3 billion kilometres; 2.8 to 4.6 billion miles) from the Sun.
Light from the Sun takes 5.5 hours
to reach Pluto at its orbital distance of 39.5 AU (5.91 billion km; 3.67 billion mi). Pluto's eccentric orbit periodically
brings it closer to the Sun than Neptune, but a stable orbital resonance prevents them from colliding.
</p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#99ccff" size="5">Pluto has five known moons:
Charon, the largest, whose diameter
is just over half that of Pluto; Styx; Nix; Kerberos; and Hydra. Pluto and Charon are sometimes considered a binary
system because the barycenter of their orbits does not lie within either body, and they are tidally locked. New Horizons
was the first spacecraft to visit Pluto and its moons, making a flyby on July 14, 2015, and taking detailed measurements
and observations.
