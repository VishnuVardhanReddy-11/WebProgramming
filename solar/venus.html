<p align="justify"><font color="#99ccff" size="5">Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is a
terrestrial planet and is the closest in mass and size to its orbital neighbour Earth. Venus has by far the
densest atmosphere of the terrestrial planets, composed mostly of carbon dioxide with a thick, global
sulfuric acid cloud cover. At the surface it has a mean temperature of 737 K (464 °C; 867
°F) and a
pressure 92 times that of Earth's at sea level. These extreme conditions compress carbon dioxide into a
supercritical state at Venus's surface.</p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#99ccff" size="5">Internally, Venus has a core, mantle, and crust. Venus
lacks an internal dynamo, and its weakly induced magnetosphere is caused by atmospheric interactions
with the solar wind. Internal heat escapes through active volcanism, resulting in resurfacing
instead of plate tectonics. Venus is one of two planets in the Solar System, the other being Mercury, that
have no moons. Conditions perhaps favourable for life on Venus have been identified at its cloud
layers. Venus may have had liquid surface water early in its history with a habitable environment,before a runaway greenhouse effect evaporated any water and turned Venus into
 
its present state</p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#99ccff" size="5">The rotation of Venus has been slowed and turned
against its orbital direction (retrograde) by the currents and drag of its atmosphere. It takes 224.7
Earth days for Venus to complete an orbit around the Sun, and a Venusian solar year is just under two
Venusian days long. The orbits of Venus and Earth are the closest between any two Solar System
planets, approaching each other in synodic periods of 1.6 years. Venus and Earth have the lowest
difference in gravitational potential of any pair of Solar System planets. This allows Venus to be the most
accessible destination and a useful gravity assist waypoint for interplanetary flights from Earth. </p>
<p align="justify"><font color="#99ccff" size="5">Venus figures prominently in human culture and in
the history of astronomy. Orbiting inferiorly , it always appears close to the Sun in Earth's sky, as either a "morning star" or an "evening star". While this is also true for Mercury, Venus
appears more prominent, since it is the third brightest object in Earth's sky after the Moon and the
Sun. In 1961, Venus became the target of the first interplanetary flight, Venera 1, followed by
many essential interplanetary firsts, such as the first soft landing on another planet by Venera 7 in 1970.
